            <h1>Portfolio</h1>
            <p>My portfolio includes romantic and lifestyle shoots that capture the connection and emotion between two
                people. I work closely with clients to make sure they feel comfortable, relaxed, and confident in front
                of the camera. In the landscape section, I share some of my favorite nature shots from wide scenic views
                to small details that often go unnoticed. Each image represents not just a location, but a moment in
                time and the feeling it captured. My style is natural, warm, and personal. I enjoy working with natural
                light, soft colors, and simple, candid moments. I believe that the best photos are
                the ones that tell a story whether it is the quiet connection between a mother and child, the laughter
                during a family session, or the peacefulness of a mountain lake at sunrise. I want every photo I take to
                make people feel something. Over the years, I have had the opportunity to participate in several local
                events and photo contests. One of the highlights of my journey so far has been winning the Lehi City
                Photography Contest in the landscape category. It was exciting to see my work recognized in this way and
                to share my love for nature photography with the community.
