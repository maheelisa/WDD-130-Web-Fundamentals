            <h1>Welcome to Elisa Mahe Photography</h1>
            <p>Hi! My name is Elisa and I was born and raised in Guatemala and now live in Utah, where the beauty of the
                mountains, forests, and changing seasons constantly inspires my work. I have always been drawn to both
                people and nature, and that is reflected in my photography. I focus on two main styles: Portrait and
                Landscape. Whether I am photographing a family, a couple, or a quiet sunset over the mountains, I try to
                capture something honest and beautiful. Photography has been a part of my life for over a decade. What
                began as a college course turned into a deep passion that has shaped the way I see the world. During my
                first semester studying audiovisual production, I held a professional camera for the first time and
                learned about composition, lighting, and visual storytelling. I instantly fell in love with the creative
                process behind every image. Since then, I have continued learning, practicing, and capturing meaningful
                moments through my lens.
