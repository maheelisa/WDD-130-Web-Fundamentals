            Welcome to Elisa Mahe Photography
            I was born and raised in Guatemala and now live in Utah, where the beauty of the mountains, forests, and
            changing seasons constantly inspires my work. I have always been drawn to both people and nature, and that
            is reflected in my photography. I focus on two main styles: portrait and landscape. Whether I am
            photographing a family, a couple, or a quiet sunset over the mountains, I try to capture something honest
            and beautiful.

            Photography has been a part of my life for over a decade. What began as a college course turned into a deep
            passion that has shaped the way I see the world. During my first semester studying audiovisual production, I
            held a professional camera for the first time and learned about composition, lighting, and visual
            storytelling. I instantly fell in love with the creative process behind every image. Since then, I have
            continued learning, practicing, and capturing meaningful moments through my lens.

        <h3>Portfolio</h3>
        <p>
            Photography Portfolio
            My portfolio includes both portraits and landscapes. In the portrait section, you will find examples of
            family sessions, individual portraits, couple photos, and lifestyle shoots. I work closely with clients to
            make sure they feel comfortable, relaxed, and confident in front of the camera. In the landscape section, I
            share some of my favorite nature shots from wide scenic views to small details that often go unnoticed.
            Each image represents not just a location, but a moment in time and the feeling it captured.

            My Photography Style
            My style is natural, warm, and personal. I enjoy working with natural light, soft colors, and simple, candid
            moments. I believe that the best photos are the ones that tell a story whether it is the quiet connection
            between a mother and child, the laughter during a family session, or the peacefulness of a mountain lake at
            sunrise. I want every photo I take to make people feel something.

            Over the years, I have had the opportunity to participate in several local events and photo contests. One of
            the highlights of my journey so far has been winning the Lehi City Photography Contest in the landscape
            category. It was exciting to see my work recognized in this way and to share my love for nature photography
            with the community.
