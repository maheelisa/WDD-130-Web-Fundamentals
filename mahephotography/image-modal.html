                Hi! My name is Elisa and I was born and raised in Guatemala and now live in Utah, where the beauty of
                the mountains, forests, and changing seasons constantly inspires my work. I have always been drawn to
                both
                people and nature, and that is reflected in my photography. I focus on two main styles: Portrait and
                Landscape. Whether I am photographing a family, a couple, or a quiet sunset over the mountains, I try to
                capture something honest and beautiful.
            </p>
            <p>
                Photography has been a part of my life for over a decade. What began as a college course turned into a
                deep passion that has shaped the way I see the world. During my first semester studying audiovisual
                production, I held a professional camera for the first time and learned about composition, lighting, and
                visual storytelling. I instantly fell in love with the creative process behind every image. Since then,
                I have continued learning, practicing, and capturing meaningful moments through my lens.
